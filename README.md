# Driver-Drowsiness-DL-Project

The Driver Drowsiness Detection using Deep Learning project focuses on enhancing road safety by developing a real-time system that can accurately detect driver drowsiness and alert the driver before a potential accident occurs. Drowsy driving is a significant factor in road accidents, and this project aims to mitigate this risk by employing machine learning techniques to monitor driver behavior and recognize signs of drowsiness.
